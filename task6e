  Scenario: Searching a Product by Category
    Given the following products exist:
      | id | name        | description         | price | in_stock | category     |
      | 1  | Test Product 1 | A product in Test Category | 9.99 | true     | Test Category  |

      | 3  | Test Product 3 | Another product in Test Category | 5.99 | true     | Test Category  |

    When I search for products in the category "Test Category"

    Then I should see the following products:
      | id | name        | description         | price | in_stock | category     |
      | 1  | Test Product 1 | A product in Test Category | 9.99 | true     | Test Category  |
