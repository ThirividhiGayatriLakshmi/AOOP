  Scenario: Listing All Products
    Given the following products exist:
      | id | name        | description         | price | in_stock | category     |
      | 1  | Test Product 1 | First test product     | 9.99 | true     | Test Category  |
      | 2  | Test Product 2 | Second test product    | 12.49 | false     | Test Category  |
      | 3  | Test Product 3 | Third test product     | 5.99 | true     | Another Category |

    When I request to list all products

    Then I should see the following products:
      | id | name        | description         | price | in_stock | category     |
      | 1  | Test Product 1 | First test product     | 9.99 | true     | Test Category  |
      | 2  | Test Product 2 | Second test product    | 12.49 | false     | Test Category  |
      | 3  | Test Product 3 | Third test product     | 5.99 | true     | Another Category |
